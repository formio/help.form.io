Staging can provide enhanced versatility when it comes to managing form and project deployments. 
By allowing for up to 10 different stages on a per project basis, users can now replicate a dev, stage, prod like workflow 
from within the Form.io platform itself.
 
Staging features are limited to projects with **Team Pro** and **Enterprise** level projects. 
If you do not have any projects with Team Pro or Enterprise level projects, you can still experience the full breath of
Staging from within any **Trial** project.

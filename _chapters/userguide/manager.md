In addition to providing a portal for Developers at https://portal.form.io, we also provide an interface for non-developers that is called the **Form Manager**.

This provides a simple interface for Business process owners who would like to contribute to the form building and management process. This interface looks like the following.

![](/assets/img/userguide/manager/manager-main.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

This also provides an interface for building forms as well as managing the data within those forms.

![](/assets/img/userguide/manager/builder.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

This feature is enabled by first enabling the Developer Portal within your deployment by providing the PRIMARY=true environment variable. Once you have done this, you will then need to [Contact Support]({{ site.baseUrl }}/support/) to have us enable this for each project that you wish to have this enabled.

The url for the Form Manager can be found per-project within your deployment at the following url.

    https://yourproject.yoursite.com/manager
    
If you are using the subdirectory method for your project resolution, then the url may look like the following.

    https://yoursite.com/yourproject/manager

If you are interested in this interface for your team, please [contact our support team]({{ site.baseUrl }}/support)

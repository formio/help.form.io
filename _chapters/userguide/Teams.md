Teams functionality allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same projects. Project administrators can create teams, assign teams with permissions to projects and add users to those teams.

Teams are limited to projects with **Team Pro** and **Commercial plans**. If you do not have any projects with Team Pro or Commercial plans, you will not be able to create a team.

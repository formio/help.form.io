Existing Resource Fields allow components within your Resources to be reutilized in other Forms or Resources. Existing Resource Fields carry over component settings like validation and input masks you have already configured. Although the components settings are carried over, they do not link Forms or Resources in any other way.

Each Resource within your project will display when the Existing Resource Fields tab is clicked. When a Resource is clicked, it will display the components found in that particular Resource. Simply drag a field just like any other component to add to a form.

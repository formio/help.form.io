We offer docker deployments as part of the commercial plans. This allows on premise deployments for companies and organizations that do not want or cannot store their data in the cloud.

In order to access the docker image for on premise deployments you must have a commercial plan. See [plans and pricing](https://form.io/pricing) for more information.

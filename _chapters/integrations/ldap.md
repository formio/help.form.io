LDAP Authentication integration provides the ability to authenticate your users directly against an LDAP service such as OpenLDAP or Active Directory.

LDAP Users are not imported into Form.io as Resources and exist only externally in LDAP. They still get assigned Form.io roles and can have ownership over forms and submissions.

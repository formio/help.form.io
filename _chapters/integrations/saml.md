SAML is a standard XML-based framework that enables different organizations (with different security domains) to securely exchange authentication and authorization information. Form.io supports the **SAML 2.0** Single Sign on standard which allows you to use your organizations authentication to automatically authenticate into a Form.io application.

There are [many software services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML-based_products_and_services) that offer SAML authentication, which makes it very easy to test out this feature capability. Here are just a few that provide SAML integration.

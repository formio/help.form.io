We have created a nodejs library called [formio-service](https://github.com/formio/formio-service) to make it easier to interface directly with **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;**. You can use it to perform administrative functionality on the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** service.

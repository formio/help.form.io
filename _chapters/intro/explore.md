When you first create an account within {{ site.formio }}, you will land on a dashboard page @ [https://portal.form.io](https://portal.form.io). We call this the {{ site.formio }} Portal, and it serves as the administrative interface for Developers to develop the **Resources** and **Forms** for their applications. This is the first page you see.

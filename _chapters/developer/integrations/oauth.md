OAuth allows you to authenticate with **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** using a 3rd party OAuth provider. This is very convenient because users may register new accounts and log in without having to manually enter a new username and password. To get your project working with OAuth, please walk through the following steps. These steps will be using a new project from the Default template, but you may use any project you wish.

Register with OAuth Provider

In order to use OAuth with a provider, you must first register your application with that provider and obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. See the Oauth providers below for instructions on how to signup for each.

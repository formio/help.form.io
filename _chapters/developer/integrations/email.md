One of the actions available on forms is the Email action. This will send out an email or emails. This can be to an administrator email or to an email address entered on the form. 

In order to send the emails out an email provider needs to be configured. By default we provide a Sendgrid account that may be used for low volumes of emails.

There are several other email providers that may be set up and monitored for your application. They can be configred in the Project Settings.

The S3 Storage provider allows file storage and retrieval using any S3 compatible service but was specifically designed for Amazon Web Services S3.

If you haven't already done so, go to [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up for an account.

In order to use S3, you will need to configure an IAM user and an S3 bucket.

#### Create an IAM user

Go to Services->IAM and click on the *Users* tab.
 
Click the **Create New Users** button.

![](/assets/img/aws-create-user.png)

Enter a user name such as "UploadUser" and be sure that "Generate an access key for each user" is checked.

Click the **Create button**

Be sure to download the credentials and save the "Show User Security Credentials". You are going to need the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key in the configuration.

Finally, go back to the Users Page for your new user and copy the User ARN. It should look like.

```
arn:aws:iam:XXXXXXX:user/UploadUser
```

#### Create an S3 bucket

Go to Services->S3

Click **Create Bucket** and enter a name and region for the bucket and create it.

Next, click on the bucket anad ensure the **Properties** tab is selected. Then open the **Permissions** fieldset.

Click **Add bucket policy** and add the following. Be sure to put the correct User ARN from earlier in the *Principal* property and change the bucket name in **both** *Resource* properties.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "UploadFile",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXX:user/UploadUser"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "crossdomainAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/crossdomain.xml"
        }
    ]
}
```

Save this and then click **Add CORS configuration** and add the following.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

You may replace ```<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>``` with the domain names of the sites your app will be running on or leave it open.

Save the configuration and the bucket settings.

Your S3 bucket should now be properly configured.

#### Enter S3 Project Settings

On form.io go to your Project Settings page and Select *File Storage* and open *S3*. Enter the information for the IAM user and S3 bucket you just created.

##### Secret Access Key

This is from the IAM user credentials.

##### Bucket Name

The name of the bucket you created.

##### Access Control List

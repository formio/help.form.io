<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p><strong>src</strong> - The src attribute is used to pass in the path to the form or form and submission to be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>form</strong> - Alternatively, you can pass in the form definition as an attribute on the formio directive.</p>
<p><strong>submissions</strong> - If submissions have already been loaded, they can be passed in as an attribute.</p>
<p><strong>perPage</strong> - The number of submissions to list per page.</p>
<p>In addition to forms that create submissions, lists of previous submissions can also be embedded within your application. This is useful for creating lists of items to display within your application.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;formio-submissions src="{formName}"&gt;&lt;/formio-submissions&gt;</code></pre>

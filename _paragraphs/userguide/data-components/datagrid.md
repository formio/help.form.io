**Data Grids** allow users to add multiple components on to a line item grid. Once placed,  
users can add multiple components inside of the **Data Grid**. Additionally, any number of grids can be added
within a form which is especially useful when needing the ability to add or duplicate multiple fields sets.

From the **Data** component menu, add the **Data Gird (Array)** to any active form. By default the grid is empty 
but can have other form components placed inside.

automatically added whenever another component is added the the data grid interface

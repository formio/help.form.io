Below the header, banner with tiles for each type of application you may want to create. To get started you can simply click on the application template you want to use, or create a custom project.

When choosing an application template, the project is immediately created and ready for editing and previewing. The title and description of the newly created project may be entered on the prompt that comes up, which can be changed by going to the project settings on the left.

When creating a custom application, you will be presented with the options for creating a project.

#### Project Title

The Project Title is the name that will be used to identify and access a specific Project throughout the entire life of the Project.  Keeping this in mind, a sensible Project naming convention should be utilized to clearly identify the Project as being associated with the corresponding customer Application in which it will be used.  

#### Description

The Project Description can be up to 512 characters and may be comprised of any letters, numbers, spaces, or other special characters. This description is simply used for reference within the Project, and is not utilized elsewhere.

When done, click **Create Project** and your new project will be created.

#### Project Template

Project Templates are predefined templates that specify what Resources, Forms, and Actions to automatically create for you. You may select from one of our existing project templates, or upload your own. Templates can be created by [exporting](#settings-project) an existing project. For more information on templates, see the [Project Templates](#project-templates) section.

<p class="note">Think of the submissions view as administrative access to the database. This should not be used for typical interaction with the Project and is not designed for end user use.</p>
<p>The Submissions page gives you an administrative overview of submissions to your forms.</p>
<p>You can see a table view of the fields that had "Table view" selected on them. To add or remove fields from this display, edit the field on the Form Edit page and uncheck "Table View"</p>
<p>From the Submissions overview page you can also view, edit and delete individual submissions to your forms. Use the icons on the right to perform these actions.</p>

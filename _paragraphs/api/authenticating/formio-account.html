<p>If you are developing an admin application or integration with a service that does not require user accounts, you can authenticate as your Form.io account.</p>
<p>In order to get the JWT Token, do a POST request to https://formio.form.io/api/user/login/submission. Be sure to send the user.email and user.password wrapped in a data object.</p>
